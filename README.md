We have made use of the ensemble method on the entirety of the dataset. It consists of independent methods like :

Logistic Regression Decision Tree Classifier RandomForest Classifier KNearest Neighbour Classifier AdaBoost Classifier

After training and testing on all these models individually we came to the conclusion that using ensemble method gives the most precise and accurate results.

A kind of diabetes known as gestational diabetes (GDM) affects pregnant women. This results from the body's improper production or use of insulin. Early diagnosis and treatment of GDM are crucial since it can have adverse effects on both the mother and the unborn child.

The risk of GDM in expectant mothers may be predicted using machine learning algorithms. These models employ data from prior pregnancies that were used to train them to identify variables that are most likely to be linked to GDM. The following elements are frequently used in machine learning models to predict GDM:

Demographic information: age, race, ethnicity and weight. Pregnancy history: previous GDM pregnancies, previous deliveries of large babies and previous preterm deliveries. Medical history: family history of diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure. Current pregnancy: Pregnancy weight gain, blood sugar and insulin levels. Machine learning models to predict GDM have been shown to be effective in identifying women at high risk of developing the disease. These models can help ensure that women at risk of GDM are identified early for appropriate treatment and follow-up. Here are some benefits of using machine learning models to predict GDM.

They can be used to identify women who are at risk of developing GDM at an early stage. They can help prevent complications for mother and baby. They can be used to monitor women with GDM and make sure they are receiving appropriate treatment. Here are some of the disadvantages of using machine learning models to predict GDM.
